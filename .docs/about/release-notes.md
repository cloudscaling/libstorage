[Proud Heng](https://github.com/proudh) | So long Proud, and thanks for all the fish. EBS is now part of a tagged release!
[Aaron Spiegel](https://github.com/spiegela) | Aaron, you may be a new contributor, but I feel like we've known each other since we were kids, running around the front-yard on a summer's dusky-eve, catching fireflies and speaking of the day we'd be patching Markdown documentation together.

## Version 0.1.2 (2016/06/13)
This release updates the default VirtualBox endpoint to `http://10.0.2.2:18083`.

## Version 0.1.1 (2016/06/10)
This is the initial GA release of libStorage.

### Features
libStorage is an open source, platform agnostic, storage provisioning and
orchestration framework, model, and API. Features include:

- A standardized storage orchestration
  [model and API](http://docs.libstorage.apiary.io/)
- A lightweight, reference client implementation with a minimal dependency
  footprint
- The ability to embed both the libStorage client and server, creating native
  application integration opportunities

### Operations
`libStorage` supports the following operations:

Resource Type | Operation | Description
--------------|-----------|------------
Volume | List / Inspect | Get detailed information about one to many volumes
       | Create / Remote | Manage the volume lifecycle
       | Attach / Detach | Provision volumes to a client
       | Mount / Unmount | Make attached volumes ready-to-use, local file systems
Snapshot | | Coming soon
Storage Pool | | Coming soon

### Getting Started
Using libStorage can be broken down into several, distinct steps:

1. Configuring [libStorage](/user-guide/config.md)
2. Understanding the [API](http://docs.libstorage.apiary.io)
3. Identifying a production server and client implementation, such as
   [REX-Ray](https://rexray.rtfd.org)
